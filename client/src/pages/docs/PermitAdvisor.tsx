## Overview

The Permit Advisor uses AI to identify required permits for your construction projects. Avoid costly delays, fines, and legal issues by ensuring you have all necessary permits before starting work.

## Why Permits Matter

Construction without proper permits can result in serious consequences. Many contractors underestimate the importance of permit compliance, leading to project delays, financial penalties, and legal complications. Permits ensure that work meets safety standards and building codes, protecting both you and your clients.

Unpermitted work can be discovered during property sales, refinancing, or insurance claims. When discovered, property owners may be required to remove or modify the work, leading to disputes over who bears the cost. In some cases, contractors face criminal charges for repeated violations. The Permit Advisor helps you avoid these scenarios by identifying all required permits upfront.

## How Permit Advisor Works

The system analyzes your project details using AI and cross-references with building codes, zoning regulations, and local requirements. It considers the project type, scope of work, location, and property characteristics to generate a comprehensive permit requirement report.

The AI has been trained on building codes from all 50 states, including the International Building Code (IBC), International Residential Code (IRC), and state-specific amendments. It also accounts for local ordinances and HOA restrictions that may apply to your project.

## Using Permit Advisor

### Starting a New Analysis

You can access the Permit Advisor from your dashboard sidebar or directly from the estimate wizard. When starting from an estimate, project details automatically populate, saving you time. For standalone analysis, you'll enter project information manually.

### Project Information Required

The system needs specific details to provide accurate permit recommendations. Start with the complete property address, including street number, city, state, and ZIP code. The address determines which jurisdiction's requirements apply.

Next, describe the project type and scope. Be specific about what work you're performing. For example, instead of "kitchen work," specify "kitchen remodel including electrical panel upgrade, new gas line for range, and structural beam removal." The more detail you provide, the more accurate the permit recommendations.

Include the project value, as many jurisdictions have different requirements based on cost thresholds. Some work under $5,000 may be exempt, while projects over $25,000 might require additional permits or inspections.

Specify whether the property is residential or commercial, as permit requirements differ significantly. Also note if the property is in a historic district, HOA community, or special zoning area, as these factors affect permit needs.

### AI Analysis Process

Once you submit the project details, the AI analyzes multiple factors. It evaluates the scope of work against building code requirements, checking for structural, electrical, plumbing, mechanical, and fire safety considerations. The system identifies which trades are involved and what permits each requires.

The AI also checks zoning compliance, ensuring the proposed work is allowed in that zone. It considers setback requirements, height restrictions, and land use regulations. For properties with HOA restrictions, the system flags potential issues that may require HOA approval in addition to government permits.

### Understanding the Report

The Permit Advisor generates a detailed report listing all required permits, organized by category. Each permit entry includes the permit name, issuing authority, estimated cost, typical processing time, and required documentation.

The report explains why each permit is required, citing specific code sections. This helps you understand the reasoning and communicate requirements to clients. The system also identifies potential exemptions, noting if certain aspects of your project might qualify for simplified permitting.

For complex projects, the report includes a recommended permit application sequence. Some permits must be obtained before others, and the system guides you through the correct order.

## Permit Categories

### Building Permits

Building permits are required for most structural work, including new construction, additions, remodels, and alterations affecting the building's structure or footprint. This includes foundation work, framing, roof modifications, and window/door changes that alter openings.

Even seemingly minor work may require building permits. Deck construction, fence installation over certain heights, and shed placement often need permits. The Permit Advisor identifies these requirements based on your local jurisdiction's thresholds.

### Electrical Permits

Electrical work almost always requires permits, with few exceptions. New circuits, panel upgrades, outlet additions, and lighting installations need electrical permits. Some jurisdictions allow homeowners to perform minor electrical work without permits, but contractors must always pull permits.

The system identifies when electrical permits are needed and whether a licensed electrician must perform the work. In some states, only licensed electricians can pull electrical permits, affecting how you structure your project team.

### Plumbing Permits

Plumbing permits cover water supply, drainage, and gas line work. New fixtures, pipe rerouting, water heater installation, and gas appliance connections require plumbing permits. Like electrical work, most jurisdictions require licensed plumbers for permitted work.

The Permit Advisor distinguishes between minor repairs (often exempt) and substantial work requiring permits. It also identifies when specialized permits are needed, such as backflow prevention device installation or grease trap requirements for commercial kitchens.

### Mechanical Permits

HVAC work, including new system installation, ductwork modifications, and equipment replacement, requires mechanical permits. Even "like-for-like" replacements often need permits to ensure proper sizing and code compliance.

The system identifies when mechanical permits are required and whether additional energy compliance documentation is needed. Many jurisdictions now require energy calculations and efficiency certifications for HVAC work.

### Specialty Permits

Depending on your project, additional specialty permits may be required. These include demolition permits for structure removal, grading permits for significant earth moving, fire sprinkler permits for fire protection systems, and sign permits for commercial signage.

The Permit Advisor identifies these specialty requirements based on your project scope, ensuring nothing is overlooked.

## Permit Application Process

### Required Documentation

Permit applications typically require detailed plans and specifications. For simple projects, hand-drawn sketches may suffice, but complex work needs professional drawings. The Permit Advisor lists specific documentation requirements for each permit.

Common requirements include site plans showing property boundaries and structure locations, floor plans indicating existing and proposed layouts, elevation drawings showing exterior changes, and electrical/plumbing schematics detailing system modifications.

You'll also need proof of property ownership or owner authorization, contractor license information, and insurance certificates. Some jurisdictions require energy calculations, structural engineering stamps, or environmental impact assessments for certain projects.

### Submission and Review

Most jurisdictions now accept online permit applications, though some still require in-person submission. The Permit Advisor provides contact information and submission instructions for your local building department.

After submission, plans undergo review by building officials. Review times vary from a few days to several weeks, depending on project complexity and department workload. The system provides typical processing times for your area.

Plan reviews often result in correction requests. Reviewers may require plan modifications, additional documentation, or clarification on certain aspects. Budget time for this back-and-forth in your project schedule.

### Fees and Costs

Permit fees vary widely by jurisdiction and project scope. Most charge based on project valuation, with fees ranging from $100 to several thousand dollars for large projects. The Permit Advisor provides estimated costs for each required permit.

Some jurisdictions charge separate fees for plan review, permit issuance, and inspections. Others bundle these into a single permit fee. The system clarifies the fee structure for your location.

## Inspections

### Required Inspections

Permitted work requires inspections at specific milestones. Common inspection points include foundation inspection before concrete pour, framing inspection before covering walls, rough-in inspections for electrical/plumbing/mechanical before drywall, and final inspection upon project completion.

The Permit Advisor lists required inspections for your project and explains what inspectors will examine at each stage. This helps you prepare and ensures work meets code before proceeding to the next phase.

### Scheduling Inspections

Schedule inspections in advance, typically 24-48 hours before you're ready. Most jurisdictions offer online scheduling, though some require phone calls. Have your permit number ready when scheduling.

Ensure work is ready for inspection before calling. Inspectors won't approve incomplete work, and failed inspections delay your project. The system provides checklists of what must be complete before each inspection.

### Failed Inspections

If work doesn't meet code, inspectors issue correction notices. Address all noted deficiencies and schedule a re-inspection. Most jurisdictions don't charge for the first re-inspection, but subsequent failures may incur fees.

Common failure reasons include improper installation, code violations, missing components, and work not matching approved plans. The Permit Advisor helps you avoid these issues by clarifying requirements upfront.

## Exemptions and Exceptions

### Common Exemptions

Some work is exempt from permits, though exemptions vary by jurisdiction. Common exemptions include minor repairs not affecting structure or systems, painting and decorating, cabinet installation without plumbing/electrical changes, and small accessory structures under specific size limits.

The Permit Advisor identifies potential exemptions for your project, but always verify with your local building department. Exemption interpretations can vary, and it's better to confirm than assume.

### When in Doubt, Get a Permit

If you're unsure whether a permit is required, err on the side of caution and obtain one. The cost and time of getting an unnecessary permit is minimal compared to the consequences of working without a required permit.

Building inspectors have broad authority to require permit applications for work they deem significant. Even if you believe work is exempt, an inspector may disagree. Having a permit protects you from disputes.

## Best Practices

Always run a Permit Advisor analysis before providing final estimates. Permit costs and timeline impacts should be included in your proposal. Inform clients about permit requirements and who will handle applications—you or them.

Apply for permits early in the project timeline. Don't wait until you're ready to start work, as delays in permit approval will delay the entire project. Build permit processing time into your schedule.

Keep permit documents on site during work. Inspectors may ask to see permits, and having them readily available demonstrates professionalism. Post permits visibly as required by local regulations.

Document all inspections and maintain records of approvals. These records prove code compliance and may be needed for future property transactions or insurance claims.

---

## Legal Compliance

Permit requirements are legal obligations, not optional guidelines. Working without required permits violates local ordinances and can result in stop-work orders, fines, and legal action. In some jurisdictions, repeated violations can lead to contractor license suspension or criminal charges.

Clients may ask you to skip permits to save money or time. Politely decline and explain the risks. Unpermitted work can void insurance coverage, affect property values, and create liability for both you and the owner.

If you discover unpermitted work during a project, document it and inform the property owner. You may need to obtain permits retroactively before proceeding. The Permit Advisor can help identify what permits are needed for existing unpermitted work.

## Troubleshooting

**Q: The AI says no permits are required, but I think they are needed.**  
A: The AI provides guidance based on typical requirements, but local jurisdictions may have unique rules. Always verify with your local building department for final confirmation.

**Q: Can I start work while waiting for permit approval?**  
A: No. Starting work before permit issuance violates regulations and may require you to remove completed work for inspection.

**Q: What if the project changes after getting permits?**  
A: Significant changes require permit amendments. Submit revised plans and pay amendment fees. Don't proceed with changes without updating permits.

**Q: Do I need permits for emergency repairs?**  
A: Emergency repairs to prevent immediate danger may proceed without permits, but you must obtain permits within a specified timeframe (often 24-48 hours).
