## Overview

The Payment Tracker helps contractors manage multi-payment projects by tracking deposits, milestone payments, and final payments. Monitor payment status, send payment reminders, and maintain clear financial records throughout project lifecycles.

## Why Use Payment Tracker?

Most construction projects involve multiple payments rather than a single lump sum. Typical payment structures include an initial deposit (usually 25-50%), progress payments at project milestones, and a final payment upon completion. Managing these payments manually through spreadsheets or paper records is time-consuming and error-prone.

The Payment Tracker centralizes all payment information, providing real-time visibility into what's been paid, what's outstanding, and when payments are due. This clarity helps you manage cash flow, follow up on overdue payments, and maintain professional client relationships.

## Payment Structures

### Deposit and Final Payment

The simplest payment structure involves two payments: an upfront deposit and a final payment upon completion. The deposit, typically 30-50% of the total project cost, covers initial material purchases and secures the client's commitment. The final payment covers the remaining balance and is due when work is completed and approved.

This structure works well for smaller projects with short timelines. It provides some upfront capital while ensuring the client retains leverage until work is satisfactory. However, for larger projects, this structure can strain contractor cash flow during the middle phases of work.

### Milestone Payments

For larger or longer projects, milestone payments provide better cash flow management. The project is divided into distinct phases, with payments tied to completion of each phase. Common milestones include project start (deposit), foundation completion, framing completion, rough-in completion, and final completion.

Milestone payments ensure steady cash flow throughout the project and reduce financial risk for both parties. Contractors receive payment as work progresses, while clients pay incrementally and can verify quality before making subsequent payments.

### Progress Payments

Some projects use percentage-based progress payments, where clients pay a percentage of the total cost at regular intervals (weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly). This approach is common in commercial construction and large residential projects.

Progress payments require careful documentation of work completed to justify each payment request. The Payment Tracker helps you document progress and generate payment requests based on completed work percentages.

## Setting Up Payment Tracking

### Creating a Payment Schedule

Start by creating a payment schedule for your project. Open the Payment Tracker from your dashboard and select the project or estimate you want to track. If you're starting from an estimate, the total project amount automatically populates.

Define each payment in your schedule by specifying the payment description (deposit, milestone name, or final payment), amount or percentage of total, and due date or trigger event. For milestone payments, describe what must be completed before payment is due.

The system calculates remaining balances automatically as you add payments. Ensure your payment schedule totals 100% of the project cost. The tracker alerts you if payments don't add up correctly.

### Payment Terms and Conditions

Clearly define payment terms for each payment in the schedule. Specify whether payment is due upon reaching a milestone, on a specific date, or within a certain number of days after invoice. Include any conditions that must be met before payment is due, such as inspection approval or material delivery.

Document accepted payment methods for each payment. Some contractors accept checks for deposits but require wire transfers for final payments. Clear communication about payment methods prevents delays and confusion.

## Tracking Payments

### Recording Received Payments

When you receive a payment, record it immediately in the system. Open the payment schedule, find the corresponding payment entry, click "Record Payment," and enter the payment date, amount received, and payment method. If the payment differs from the scheduled amount, note the reason for the discrepancy.

The system updates the project's payment status automatically, showing remaining balance, percentage paid, and next payment due. This real-time tracking ensures you always know where you stand financially on each project.

### Partial Payments

Sometimes clients make partial payments rather than paying the full scheduled amount. The Payment Tracker handles partial payments by allowing you to record any amount received. The system tracks the remaining balance for that payment and updates the overall project balance.

For example, if a milestone payment of $10,000 is due but the client pays $7,000, record the $7,000 and the system shows $3,000 remaining for that milestone. You can then follow up specifically for the outstanding $3,000 rather than the full milestone amount.

### Payment Status Indicators

The Payment Tracker uses clear status indicators to show payment status at a glance. Status options include Pending for payments not yet due, Due for payments that have reached their due date, Overdue for payments past their due date, Partial for payments partially received, and Paid for payments received in full.

Color coding makes status immediately visible. Green indicates paid, yellow shows due soon, and red highlights overdue payments. This visual system helps you prioritize follow-up actions and identify projects needing attention.

## Payment Reminders

### Automated Reminders

The Payment Tracker can send automated payment reminders to clients. Configure reminders to send a few days before payment is due, on the due date if payment hasn't been received, and at intervals after the due date for overdue payments.

Reminders include payment details such as amount due, due date, project description, and payment methods. They also include a direct link for clients to view their payment schedule and make payments if you've integrated payment processing.

### Manual Follow-Up

For sensitive situations or high-value payments, you may prefer manual follow-up. The Payment Tracker provides templates for payment reminder emails and generates reports showing exactly what's owed and when it was due. This documentation supports professional, factual communication about overdue payments.

When following up on overdue payments, maintain a professional tone and assume good faith. Many payment delays result from oversight, administrative issues, or temporary cash flow problems rather than refusal to pay. Polite, clear communication usually resolves issues quickly.

## Reporting and Analytics

### Project Payment Status

View payment status across all projects from a single dashboard. See which projects are fully paid, which have payments due soon, and which have overdue balances. This overview helps you manage cash flow and prioritize collection efforts.

Filter and sort projects by various criteria including payment status, client name, project value, or due date. Search functionality helps you quickly locate specific projects or clients.

### Cash Flow Projections

The Payment Tracker projects future cash flow based on scheduled payments. See expected income by week, month, or quarter. These projections help you plan for expenses, manage working capital, and make informed business decisions.

Projections account for historical payment patterns. If certain clients typically pay late, the system can adjust projections accordingly, providing more realistic cash flow forecasts.

### Client Payment History

Track payment history by client to identify reliable payers and problematic accounts. See average days to payment, percentage of on-time payments, and total amounts paid. This information helps you make decisions about payment terms for future projects with the same clients.

Clients with excellent payment history might qualify for more favorable terms, while those with poor payment records might require larger deposits or stricter payment schedules.

## Integration with Other Features

### Estimates and Contracts

Payment schedules created in the Payment Tracker can be referenced in estimates and contracts. When generating a contract from an estimate, include the payment schedule directly in the contract terms. This ensures clients understand and agree to the payment structure before work begins.

The contract should clearly state what triggers each payment, acceptable payment methods, and consequences for late payment. Having payment terms in writing prevents disputes and provides legal protection if collection becomes necessary.

### Invoicing

When a payment becomes due, generate an invoice directly from the Payment Tracker. The invoice automatically includes the correct amount, due date, and project details. This integration eliminates manual data entry and ensures consistency between your payment tracking and invoicing.

Link invoices back to the payment schedule so you can see which invoice corresponds to which payment. This connection provides a complete audit trail from estimate to payment.

## Best Practices

### Clear Communication

Discuss payment schedules with clients before starting work. Ensure they understand when payments are due, what triggers each payment, and what happens if payments are late. Clear communication upfront prevents misunderstandings and payment disputes.

Provide clients with a written payment schedule, either as part of the contract or as a separate document. Some contractors give clients a copy of the Payment Tracker schedule so everyone has the same information.

### Consistent Follow-Up

Establish and maintain consistent follow-up procedures. Send reminders before payments are due to give clients time to arrange payment. Follow up promptly when payments are late, starting with friendly reminders and escalating if necessary.

Document all payment-related communications. If disputes arise or collection becomes necessary, having a record of your communication efforts strengthens your position.

### Flexible but Firm

Be understanding of genuine payment difficulties while maintaining firm boundaries. If a client has a temporary cash flow issue, you might agree to a short extension or modified payment plan. However, don't continue work if payments fall significantly behind.

Some contractors implement a policy of stopping work if payments are more than a certain number of days overdue. This policy protects you from doing extensive work that may never be paid for.

### Accurate Record Keeping

Maintain accurate, detailed records of all payments. Record the exact amount, date, and method for every payment received. Keep copies of checks, transaction confirmations, and receipts. These records are essential for accounting, tax purposes, and potential legal proceedings.

Reconcile your Payment Tracker records with your bank statements regularly to ensure accuracy. Discrepancies should be investigated and resolved immediately.

## Legal Considerations

Payment schedules and terms should comply with local regulations. Some jurisdictions limit deposit amounts (often to 10-33% of total cost) or require specific disclosures about payment terms. Consult with a legal professional to ensure your payment practices comply with applicable laws.

If payments become significantly overdue, you may need to pursue legal remedies such as filing a mechanic's lien, sending a demand letter, or initiating small claims court proceedings. The Payment Tracker documentation supports these actions by providing clear records of what was owed and when.

## Troubleshooting

**Q: What if a client wants to change the payment schedule?**  
A: You can modify payment schedules, but document changes in writing and have both parties agree. Update the contract if necessary and ensure the new schedule still protects your interests.

**Q: How do I handle early payments?**  
A: Record early payments when received and update the schedule. Consider offering a small discount for early payment to incentivize this behavior.

**Q: What if a client stops paying mid-project?**  
A: Stop work immediately if payments fall significantly behind. Communicate clearly about the situation, attempt to resolve the issue, and consider legal remedies if necessary. Don't continue working in hopes of eventual payment.

**Q: Can I charge interest on late payments?**  
A: If your contract includes late payment interest provisions, you can charge interest. Clearly state interest rates and terms in contracts. Check local regulations, as some jurisdictions limit interest rates.
