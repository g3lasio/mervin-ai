## Overview

Property Verification helps contractors verify property ownership and details before creating estimates or starting work. Protect yourself from fraud and ensure you're dealing with the actual property owner.

## Why Verify Property Ownership?

- Save report for records

**⚠️ Partial Match:**
- Similar names (spelling variations)
- Possible nickname vs. legal name
- Ask client for ID verification

**❌ No Match:**
- Client name doesn't match owner
- **DO NOT PROCEED** without clarification
- Request explanation from client
- Verify client's relationship to owner

## Best Practices

### When to Verify

✅ **Always verify for:**
- New clients you've never worked with
- Projects over $5,000
- Properties in unfamiliar areas
- Clients who seem evasive about ownership
- Rental properties (verify landlord is owner)

✅ **Consider verifying for:**
- All commercial projects
- Projects requiring permits
- Work involving structural changes
- Any situation that feels "off"

### After Verification

**If Everything Checks Out:**
1. Save the verification report
2. Attach to estimate/contract
3. Proceed with confidence
4. Keep report for 7 years (legal requirement)

**If Red Flags Appear:**
1. Discuss findings with client
2. Request additional documentation
3. Consider requiring:
   - Larger deposit (50-75%)
   - Payment before starting
   - Lien waiver from owner
4. Consult attorney if major concerns

**If Ownership Doesn't Match:**
1. **Stop immediately**
2. Request explanation
3. Ask for:
   - Power of attorney documents
   - Property management agreement
   - Owner authorization letter
4. Contact owner directly if possible

**Recommendation**: For very large projects (>$50,000), consider:
- Title search by title company
- Attorney review
- Direct contact with county recorder

### Privacy & Compliance

- All data from public records
- Compliant with Fair Credit Reporting Act
- No credit checks performed
- Data used only for verification purposes

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Q: Address not found in database**  
A: Try variations (St. vs Street, Ave vs Avenue). For new construction, data may not be available yet.

**Q: Multiple properties returned**  
A: Refine search with unit number or additional details. Choose the correct property from results.

**Q: Owner information seems outdated**  
A: Public records may have 30-90 day delay. Ask client for recent closing documents.

**Q: Can I verify properties outside the US?**  
A: No. Currently limited to US properties only.

**Q: What if property is in a trust with a complex name?**  
A: Trust names can be long and complex. Focus on matching the trustee name with your client.

## Real-World Example

### Scenario: Deck Installation

**Client Request:**
- "John Smith" requests $15,000 deck installation
- Property: 123 Main St, Austin, TX

**Verification Results:**
- **Owner**: Sarah Johnson (not John Smith)
- **Ownership**: Individual
- **Purchase Date**: 2020
- **No liens or red flags**

**Action Taken:**
1. Asked "John Smith" about ownership discrepancy
2. Client revealed he's Sarah's boyfriend, lives there
3. Requested Sarah's authorization
4. Sarah confirmed and co-signed estimate
5. Project proceeded successfully

**Outcome**: Verification prevented potential payment dispute. Sarah confirmed authorization, and payment was received on time.
